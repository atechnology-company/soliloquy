# soliloquy
big ass project part 2

### here's the idea
soliloquy is what chromeos should've been, with a [plates](https://github.com/atechnology-company/plates) frontend (optional). 

based on the zircon microkernel, with only minimal functionality - no legacy baggage, no compatibility layers. it is web native, with its own hybrid browser engine, with servo (webrender stylo) + rusty v8 + wgpu acceleration.

i need to make drivers **fuck**
anyways
